# FinOptima Test Website

A React-based web application for FinOptima Solutions.

## Deployment Setup

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- S3 Bucket configured for static website hosting
- CloudFront distribution (optional, for CDN)
- GitHub repository

### AWS Setup
1. Create an S3 bucket
2. Enable static website hosting
3. Apply the bucket policy from `bucket-policy.json`
4. Create a CloudFront distribution (optional)

### GitHub Secrets Setup
Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret key
- `AWS_REGION`: Your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
- `S3_BUCKET`: Your S3 bucket name
- `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`: Your CloudFront distribution ID (if using CloudFront)

### Deployment
The application will automatically deploy to S3 when changes are pushed to the main branch.

## Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
